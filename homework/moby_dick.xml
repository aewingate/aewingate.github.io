			<p>CALL me <name>Ishmael</name>. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <earth type="noun">shore</earth>, I thought I would <water type="verb">sail</water> about a little and see the <water type="adj">watery</water> part of the <earth type="noun">world</earth>. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a <water type="adj">damp</water>, <water type="adj">drizzly</water> November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the <earth>street</earth>, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to <water type="noun">sea</water> as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish <name viaf="99852885">Cato</name> throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the <water type="noun">ship</water>. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <water type="noun">ocean</water> with me.</p>
	<p>There now is your <earth>insular</earth> <earth>city</earth> of the Manhattoes, belted round by <earth>wharves</earth> as Indian <earth>isles</earth> by <earth>coral reefs</earth>—commerce surrounds it with her <water type="noun">surf</water>. Right and left, the <earth>streets</earth> take you <water type="noun">waterward</water>. Its extreme <earth>down-town</earth> is the battery, where that noble mole is <water type="verb">washed</water> by <water type="noun">waves</water>, and cooled by <air>breezes</air>, which a few hours previous were out of sight of <earth>land</earth>. Look at the crowds of <water type="noun">water-gazers</water> there.</p>
			<p>Circumambulate the <earth>city</earth> of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from <place type="area" latitude="40.712008409108805" longitude="-73.97828017191114">Corlears Hook</place> to <place type="street" latitude="40.70368998323214" longitude="-74.01039091784246">Coenties Slip</place>, and from thence, by</p>
