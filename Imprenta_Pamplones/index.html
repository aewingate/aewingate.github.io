		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p><i>Imprenta Pamplonés</i> documents the printing output of Pamplona, Spain during the 16th centuries using data from the <a href="https://iberian.ucd.ie/"><i>Iberian Books</i> database</a>. This site is intended to act as a kind of online bibliography that combines the advantages of print bibliographies and the online environment. Like a print bibliography, bibliographic items are arranged in a list according to a specific ordering principle (author last name, year of publication, etc.). This list format allows for easier browsability as compared to some databases. Unlike a print bibliography, creating and hosting multiple lists of the same content organized according to different ordering principles is a much easier prospect. Hyperlinking within these lists also allows for easy, non-sequential consultation as in a print book. </p>
		<p>Within each list or index, books are listed with their author(s), title, and imprint. Clicking on these items leads to individual pages containing additional metadata for each book. In some cases, a digital facsimile may be consulted directly from the item page. All pages also include hyperlinks back to their respective entry in original <i>Iberian Books</i> database. This site is generated from the Dublic Core metadata available on those entry pages.</p>
